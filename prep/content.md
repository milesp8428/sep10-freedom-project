Topic: **Architecture**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
This is the content that I will put in my website about architecture. There is existing technology in part A and there is ideas that I came up with in part B that I thoughot would be useful for an archetect.

## Part A: existing technology

* V-Ray
  * V-Ray is a tool for architects that plugs into 3D programs like SketchUp and Revit to turn basic models into high-quality, lifelike images and animations.
  * Think of V-Ray as the camera for your architectural drawings. It adds real-world lighting, shadows, and materials to your digital designs, so they look like actual photos before they are ever built.

## Part B: possible future 
* Solar panel windows.
  * When you are gone you can put down your solar panel windows and they will act as solar panels on your windows.
  * It could have a switch that you could hit to put them down or up.
  * There could be an AI the detects when you have left the house and it would put down the solar panels.
  * If a light is off they could go down in that room.
  * They could turn to the sun to get as much sunlight as possible.
* An app that architects could use to help them make sketches.
  * You can put in the location you are going to make your building in.
  * The amount of room you have to work with.
  * What style you want to use.
  * The amount of money you are able to use.
  * What materials you want to use.
  * The app will use AI to give you sketches of both the inside and the outside of the building.
  * It will  give you a fooler plan.
  * You can make revisions until you get what you are looking for.
