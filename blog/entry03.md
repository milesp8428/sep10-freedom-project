<p> While brainstorming possible future inventions that could be added to architecture. I was thinking of what could be beneficial to both the consumer and the architect. What I mean is, I didn't just think about what could benefit Architects and make their job easier; I also thought about what could make the person buying the products' life easier. What I first came up with was Windows that had solar panels on them so when you left the house the solar panels went down. This would be a great way to save energy without taking up a lot of space. Along with this I also came up with an app that Architects could use. This app would have everything that you would need to know if you wanted to build a building somewhere you can put in the location you are going to make your building in, the amount of room you have to work with, what style of architecture you want to use, the amount of money you can spend, and what materials you want to use. The app will also use AI to give you sketches of both the inside and the outside of the building, a floor plan, and you can make revisions until you get what you are looking for.</p>


<h1> Sources </h1>
<p> A source that I used to get information from was <a href="https://selenag1958.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/" target="_blank">selenag1958 freedom-project</a>. Although we talked about different things about architecture, the idea of a hologram sparked the idea for me to think of an app. This is very useful because I was able to see what other people put for their part of this project and that allowed me to get a better understanding of what I should put for my project. Some other sources I used were <a href= "https://johnnyy5929.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/" target="_blank">johnnyy5929 freedom-project</a>, and <a href="https://kosall5220.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/" target="_blank">kosall5220 freedom-project</a>. And although these weren't at all related to my project they still gave me good insight to how technology can be used in the future. It made me think of how I could apply technology similar to theirs onto architecture.

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>I am in the second step of the engineering design process. I decided that instead of rushing it and moving on to stage 3, I would take more time to do more research on Step 2. I think it's best to be as thorough as possible in this part because it will decide how the rest of the project will go. In step 3 I hope to come up with a solution to be able to inform more people about architecture.

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>One of the skills I have developed is how to think creatively. Sometimes when a task is difficult I have to rely on technology to understand how something works but this stops me from thinking of my own ideas.  Sometimes I will be faced with a problem that does not have a clear answer. This forces me to think creatively to be able to find a solution to this problem. Now that I understand how to think creatively I can apply it to other things in my life. Another skill I've developed is how to embrace failure. Recently  I didn't do very great on a project. But instead of being upset and not taking anything out of this situation I now know the amount of effort I should be putting in and I won't make this same mistake again.
