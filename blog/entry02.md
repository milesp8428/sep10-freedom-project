Well researching hardware/software for architecture I came across many useful tools and apps that Architects use to make jobs easier. One of them is called sketchup, sketchup is a website that allows architects to help their clients visualize what they are making by creating a 3d model.  When I was looking for software for architecture I was able to find many interesting things by searching software for architecture but nothing was quite what I was looking for. Until I searched for a 3D model architecture tool. SketchUp was one of the first ones to come up. A similar thing happened when I was searching for hardware for architecture. I searched up Hardware for architecture and not a lot of useful things came up. They were things like hard hats or pencils which weren't what I was looking for. I changed my search to architecture gadgets and one of the things that came up were laser measures. A laser measurer is something that lets you measure the distance between two points. It measures the amount of time it takes for the light to get to the point  you are measuring and it calculates the distance very quickly.This is very useful for Architects because if you were measuring something like a ceiling a tape measurer would be very difficult to use.
