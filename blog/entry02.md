<p> While researching hardware/software for architecture I came across many useful tools and apps that Architects use to make jobs easier. One of them is called sketchup, sketchup is a website that allows architects to help their clients visualize what they are making by creating a 3d model. When I was looking for software for architecture I was able to find many interesting things by searching software for architecture but nothing was quite what I was looking for. Until I searched for a 3D model architecture tool. SketchUp was one of the first ones to come up. A similar thing happened when I was searching for hardware for architecture. I searched up Hardware for architecture and not a lot of useful things came up. They were things like hard hats or pencils which weren't what I was looking for. I changed my search to architecture gadgets and one of the things that came up were laser measures. A laser measurer is something that lets you measure the distance between two points. It measures the amount of time it takes for the light to get to the point  you are measuring and it calculates the distance very quickly. This is very useful for Architects because if you were measuring something like a ceiling a tape measurer would be very difficult to use.</p>

<h1> Sources </h1>
<p> There have been many different things that have been useful while researching architecture. While researching hardware and software I found that using Google was a great way to start. From there I found <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/architecture/" target="_blank">"awwwards"</a>,
<a href="https://oda-architecture.com/" target="_blank">"oda-architecture"</a>,
<a href="https://www.archdaily.com/" target="_blank">"archdaily"</a>. These websites have given me a deeper insight to what architecture is really like and overall exposed me more to my topic. </p>

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
I am in the second step of the engineering design process. In step one I decided what my goal was. My goal for the Engineering Design Process was to spread information about how technology is related to the architecture around you. In step two I wanted to do more research and have a better understanding of my goal and architecture in general. Although I have done some research I think it would be helpful if I did more. In the next step I would like to research possible solutions for my problem.

<h1>Skills</h1>
One of the skills I have learned so far is how to Google effectively to find what I'm looking for. When I was looking for Hardware for architecture I found that just simply typing into the Google search bar architecture Hardware didn't give me what I needed.  This forced me to try other Google searches until I was able to find what I was looking for. The skill can be useful in other situations like if you had to do research on a topic and didn't know where to start. It would be very helpful to know how to search on Google to find what you're looking for. Another skill I learned was how to budget my time so that I can put a better quality of work into what I'm doing. I knew that this blog was going to take me over an hour to do. But I didn't want to wait until right before I went to bed to do this because I didn't want to rush it and put in a lower quality of work. So I paced myself throughout the day chipping slowly at the project. This gave me time to look over what I wrote and make revisions that I felt were necessary.
