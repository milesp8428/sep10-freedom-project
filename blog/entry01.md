<h1> SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
<h1>Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Architecture)</h1>
<h5>10/13/25</h5>
<h2>Choosing a topic</h2>
<p>The topic I chose was Architecture because I have always had an interest in structure and how things come together to make something great. Because I have lived in New York my entire life I have seen architecture all around me this is what sparked my fascination. So this made it obvious what I wanted to integrate technology into for the freedom project. I have done a lot of research on architecture, specifically bridges. I find it very interesting that there are many types of bridges meant for varying factors like distance and other things. Some of the articals i looked at I found interesting like <a href="https://blog.enerpac.com/7-types-of-bridges-every-engineer-should-know-about/" target="_blank">"7 Types of Bridges Every Engineer Should Know About"</a> by enerpac, <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/academics/architecture-and-design/" target="_blank">"School of Architecture and Design | New York Tech"</a> by  The New York Institute of Technology and <a href="https://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/what-is-architecture-2/" target="_blank">"What is Architecture?"</a> by Life of an Architect. These articals are what got me interested and are one of the main reasons why I choese this topic for my project.</p>

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>I am in the fist step of the engineering design process. The point of the first step is to find a goal. The goal i chose was to spered information about how techknolgy has to due with the acractacture around you. In step 2 i will do reaserch about this topcic to have a better over all understanding of what my goal is about befor i inform others.  </p>

<h1>Skills</h1>

<h3>Reaserchinng</h3>
<p>A skill that i learned wile doing this blog was how to reaserch. This skill is important becuse not only did i just reserch about arcatectuere i also reaserched about the diffrent jobs and what they offer. For exsamle i leaned what the diffrences bettween a structral enganer  and a arcatect were. Part of reaserching is finding key information, this is not as easy as one might think to find true information takes a lot of work but luckaly this bloge has tought me how to reaserch effectavly. 
<h3>Problem Solving </h3>
  I have learned how to problem solve. wile reaserching i have come acros information that was hard to understand insed of moving on i would go over it again and if that didnt work i would look up a spasifc frace or term i was having trubble with. This gave me a better undersanding of what i was reaserching.

<h1>summery</h1>
<p>I am looking forward to moving on with this prodject and being able to inform more people about have techkolgy effects arcatchor.</p>
