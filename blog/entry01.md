<h1> SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
<h1>Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Architecture)</h1>
<h5>10/13/25</h5>
<h2>Choosing a topic</h2>
<p>The topic I chose was Architecture because I have always had an interest in structure and how things come together to make something great. Because I have lived in New York my entire life I have seen architecture all around me this is what sparked my fascination. So this made it obvious what I wanted to integrate technology into for the freedom project. I have done a lot of research on architecture, specifically bridges. I find it very interesting that there are many types of bridges meant for varying factors like distance and other things. Some of the articals i looked at I found interesting like <a href="https://blog.enerpac.com/7-types-of-bridges-every-engineer-should-know-about/" target="_blank">"7 Types of Bridges Every Engineer Should Know About"</a> by enerpac, <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/academics/architecture-and-design/" target="_blank">"School of Architecture and Design | New York Tech"</a> by  The New York Institute of Technology and <a href="https://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/what-is-architecture-2/" target="_blank">"What is Architecture?"</a> by Life of an Architect. These articals are what got me interested and are one of the main reasons why I choese this topic for my project.</p>

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>I am in the first step of the engineering design process. The first step is to find a goal. The goal I chose was to spread information about how technology is related to the architecture around you. In step 2 I will do research about this topic to have a better overall understanding of what my goal is about before I inform others. </p>

<h1>Skills</h1>

<h3>Reaserchinng</h3>
<p>A skill that I learned while doing this blog was how to research. This skill is important because not only did I just research architecture I also researched different jobs and what they offer. For example, I learned what the differences between a structural engineer and an architect were. Part of researching is finding key information, this is not as easy as one might think to find true information takes a lot of work but luckily this blog has taught me how to research effectively. 
<h3>Problem Solving </h3>
 I have learned how to problem-solve. While researching I have come across information that was hard to understand. Instead of moving on I would go over it again and if that didn't work I would look up a specific phrase or term I was having trouble with. This gave me a better understanding of what I was researching.
</p>
<h1>summary</h1>
<p>I am looking forward to moving on with this project and being able to inform more people about how technology affects architecture.</p>
