<h2>Choosing a topic</h2>
<p>The topic i choses was Architecture becuse i have always had an intrist in structure and how things come together to make something grate. Becuse i have lived in New York my entier life i have seen acratectuer all around me this is what sparked my fasanation. So this made it ovius what i whanted to intergreat techknolagy into for the freedom project. I have done a lot of reserch on achetecture spisificaly bridges i find it very ineresting that there are many types of brides ment for varying facturs like didtance and other things. Some of the articals i looked at and found <a href="https://blog.enerpac.com/7-types-of-bridges-every-engineer-should-know-about/" target="_blank">"7 Types of Bridges Every Engineer Should Know About"</a> by enerpac. These articals are what got me intersted and are one of the main resons why i choese this topic for my project.</p>

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>I am in the fist step of the engineering design process. The point of the first step is to find a goal. The goal i chose was to spered information about how techknolgy has to due with the acractacture around you. In step 2 i will do reaserch about this topcic to have a better over all understanding of what my goal is about befor i inform others.  </p>

<h1>Skills</h1>

<h3>Reaserchinng</h3>
<p>A skill that i learned wile doing this blog was how to reaserch. This skill is important becuse not only did i just reserch about arcatectuere i also reaserched about the diffrent jobs and what they offer. Part of reaserching is finding key information, this is not as easy as one might think to find true information takes a lot of work but luckaly this bloge has tought me how to reaserch effectavly. </p>
